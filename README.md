This Web Crawler, written in **Python3**, uses **Selenium** to do the following:
- Collects price information of a desired product from listings in CraigsList,
- Prints out the collected information in Terminal(Mac OS), then
- Closes web browser

It allows the users to view listings in a simpler format, since it automatically filters out the unneccessary information of the individual listings.
